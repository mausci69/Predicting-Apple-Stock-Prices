# Predicting-Apple-Stock-Prices
Using an LSTM, we predict one month of Apple stock prices.

LSTM means Long Short-Term Memory and it is a specific RNN, Recurrent Neral Network.
Recurrent Neural Networks are an algorythm that is having a great success lately, specifically in 
NLP, Natural Langage Processing - Apple Siri uses it.

In this small project, we uses it for stock predictions.

This idea has been developed by Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves in their "Deep Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks" course, available in Udemy.

Even though we shouldn't rely in the neural networks (or in any other tool) ability to predict stock prices, this example shows how, in absence of perturbations, LSTM could be having interesting applications in this field.
